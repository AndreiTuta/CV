Hello,
I am Andrei Tuta.
I just finished my Computer Science degree at Birmingham City University and at the moment work as a programming assistant at a summer camp in Massachusetts, US. Here, my tasks are to help middle and high school children better understand coding concepts and produce brilliant pieces of software, focused on drawing, animation and games using Processing, a Java IDE specially built for this purpose. Apart from assisting those workshops, I also run my own workshop about coding basic games such as Monopoly, Werewolf etc using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Apart from the experience gained in University, I attended several Hackathons both in the UK and outside the UK, being nominated for prizes multiple times. During those Hackathons I learned a lot about programming and numerous programming languages, but mainly I like programming in Python for its versatility and in JS(Angular/React/Meteor) depending on the requirements.

For further inquiries, please check my resume, which you can find attached to this email.

Thank you and have a great day!
Best regards,
Andrei Tuta
