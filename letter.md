Hello,

Thank you very much for reaching out.

I am Andrei Tuta.
I just finished my Computer Science degree at Birmingham City University and at the moment work as programming assistant at a summer camp in Massachusetts,US. Here, my tasks are to help middle and high school children better understand coding concepts and produce brilliant pieces of software , focused on drawing, animation and games using Processing, a Java IDE specially built for this purpose. Apart of assisting those workshops, I also run my on workshop about coding basic games such as Monopoly, Werewolf etc using HTML,CSS, and JS.

Apart of the experience gained in University I attended several Hackathons both in UK and outside UK, being nominated for prizes multiple times. During those Hackathons I learned a lot about programming and numerous programming languages, but mainly I like programming in Python for itâ€™s versatility and in JS(Angular/React/Meteor) depending on the requirements.

For further inquires, please check my resume, which you can find attached to this email.

Thank you and have a great day!
Best regards,
Andrei Tuta
